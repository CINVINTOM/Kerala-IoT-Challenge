# Kerala-IoT-Challenge
> "Kerala IoT Challenge 2021" is a program launched by Foxlab Makerspace in association with GTech - Group of Technology Companies in Kerala to mold IoT experts in Kerala.
# About Me
>Hello everyoneüëã, I am Cinvin Tom, a 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering student from College of Engineering Chengannur, I  am participating in this IoT challenge to learn more about the IoT and help others to learn IoT and complete the Kerala IoT Challenge 2021.

# Level 1
>In level 1 we are using Arduino for the experiments,
>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects.  
>I am using Arduino UNO and Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software for level 1

## Arduino UNO

>Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc. It has several advantages over the conventional microcontrollers. It comes with a pre-tested software and hardware libraries and has its own integrated development environment (IDE). Also it is less expensive & beginner friendly.

# Exp 1: Hello World LED Blinking
>we are starting our IoT journey¬†by Hello World LED Blinking using the microcontroller Arduino UNO

## Components Required
1) Arduino Uno Board  
2) USB Cable  
3) LED (Any Color) x 1 Nos  
4) 220 OHM Resistor X 1 Nos  
5) Breadboard  
6) Jumper Wires (Male to Male ) X 2 Nos

## Code

```
 int ledPin = 9; //for define digital pin 9
void setup() {
 
 pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);//define ledPin as an OUTPUT
 
}

void loop() {
  
 digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);//set LED on
 delay(1000);//wait for 1000 millisecond or 1 second
 digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);//set the LED off
 delay(1000);
 
}

```

## Output
> The LED is blinked with a time interval of 1 second

# Exp 2 : Traffic Light
>we have done the LED blinking experiment with one LED.Now its time for an upgrade, we use 3 LEDs with different colors to simulate working of an Traffic light

## Components Required
1) Arduino Uno Board  
2) USB Cable  
3) LED   
   - Red M5 LED x 1 Nos  
   - Yellow M5 LED x 1 Nos  
   - Green M5 LED x 1 Nos  
     
4) 220 OHM Resistor X 1 Nos  
5) Breadboard  
6) Jumper Wires (Male to Male ) X 4 Nos

## Code

```
int redled = 8; // initialize digital pin 8.
int yellowled =5; // initialize digital pin 5.
int greenled = 2; // initialize digital pin 2.
void setup()
{
  pinMode(redled, OUTPUT); // set the pin with red LED as ‚Äúoutput‚Äù
  pinMode(yellowled, OUTPUT); // set the pin with yellow LED as ‚Äúoutput‚Äù
  pinMode(greenled, OUTPUT);  // set the pin with green LED as ‚Äúoutput‚Äù
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(greenled, HIGH); // turn on green LED
  delay(5000); // wait 5 seconds

  digitalWrite(greenled, LOW); // turn off green LED
  for(int i=0;i<3;i++) // blinks for 3 times
  {
    delay(500); // wait 0.5 second
    digitalWrite(yellowled, HIGH); // turn on yellow LED
    delay(500);
    digitalWrite(yellowled, LOW); // turn off yellow LED
  }
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(redled, HIGH); // turn on red LED
  delay(5000);
  digitalWrite(redled, LOW); // turn off red LED
}

```

## Output
> The LED is blinked alternatively like a traffic light
